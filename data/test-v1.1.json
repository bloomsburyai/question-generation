The head of drama, Canadian Sydney Newman, was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) Donald Wilson and staff writer C. E. Webber. Writer Anthony Coburn, story editor David Whitaker and initial producer Verity Lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series.[note 1] The programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience, as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963 Whitaker commissioned Terry Nation to write a story under the title The Mutants. As originally written, the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"bug-eyed monsters\". The first serial had been completed and the BBC believed it was crucial that the next one be a success, but The Mutants was the only script ready to go, so the show had little choice but to use it. According to producer Verity Lambert; \"We didn't have a lot of choice \u2014 we only had the Dalek serial to go ... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.\" Nation's script became the second Doctor Who serial \u2013 The Daleks (a.k.a. The Mutants).

In 1974 the museum had acquired what is now the Henry Cole wing from the Royal College of Science. In order to adapt the building as galleries, all the Victorian interiors except for the staircase were recast during the remodelling. To link this to the rest of the museum, a new entrance building was constructed on the site of the former boiler house, the intended site of the Spiral, between 1978 and 1982.

The first step of the Factory Project was to take photographs utilizing digital cameras. The Word and Image Department had a collection of old photos but they were in black and white and in variant conditions, so new photos were shot. Those new photographs will be accessible to researchers to the Victoria and Albert Museum web-site. 15,000 images were taken during the first year of the Factory Project, including drawings, watercolors, computer-generated art, photographs, posters, and woodcuts. The second step of the Factory Project is to catalog everything. The third step of the Factory Project is to audit the collection. All of those items which were photographed and cataloged, must be audited to make sure everything listed as being in the collection was physically found during the creation of the Factory Project.

In the Georgian age there was increasing emphasis on entertainment and leisure. For example, the increase in tea drinking led to the production of tea paraphernalia such as china and caddies.

In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure (LP) cylinders. The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, torque variability can be reduced. To derive equal work from lower-pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume.

The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage.

The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages.

Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction.

When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality.

Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008\u20131074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250\u20131316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq\u2019s contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking.[verification needed]", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 40, "text": "botany and chemistry"}, {"answer_start": 40, "text": "botany and chemistry"}, {"answer_start": 4, "text": "advances made in the Middle East in botany and chemistry"}], "question": "Developments in which scientists influenced the creation of pharmacology in medieval Islam?", "id": "5726ddf6f1498d1400e8ee04"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 131, "text": "Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi"}, {"answer_start": 131, "text": "Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi"}, {"answer_start": 131, "text": "Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi"}], "question": "Who was influential in promoting the use of chemical compounds as medicines?", "id": "5726ddf6f1498d1400e8ee05"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 249, "text": "Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi"}, {"answer_start": 249, "text": "Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi"}, {"answer_start": 249, "text": "Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi"}], "question": "Who authored the Liber servitoris?", "id": "5726ddf6f1498d1400e8ee06"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1570, "text": "Al-Muwaffaq"}, {"answer_start": 1570, "text": "Al-Muwaffaq"}, {"answer_start": 1570, "text": "Al-Muwaffaq"}], "question": "Who wrote about the distillation of drinking water from sea water?", "id": "5726ddf6f1498d1400e8ee08"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1838, "text": "sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate"}, {"answer_start": 1838, "text": "sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate"}, {"answer_start": 1838, "text": "sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate"}], "question": "Which two compounds did Al-Muwaffaq differentiate between?", "id": "5726ddf6f1498d1400e8ee07"}]}, {"context": "In Europe there are old pharmacies still operating in Dubrovnik, Croatia, located inside the Franciscan monastery, opened in 1317; and in the Town Hall Square of Tallinn, Estonia, dating from at least 1422.

The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patents were questionable, he could not claim infringement on those same patents (there are claims the high court was trying to nullify a World War I claim against the U.S. government by the Marconi Company via simply restoring Tesla's prior patent).", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 3, "text": "1900"}, {"answer_start": 3, "text": "1900"}, {"answer_start": 3, "text": "1900"}], "question": "When did Tesla attain his electrical transmitter patent?", "id": "56e0fc3f7aa994140058e877"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 132, "text": "Marconi"}, {"answer_start": 122, "text": "Guglielmo Marconi"}, {"answer_start": 122, "text": "Guglielmo Marconi"}], "question": "Who first sent radio waves across the Atlantic?", "id": "56e0fc3f7aa994140058e878"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 203, "text": "1901"}, {"answer_start": 203, "text": "1901"}, {"answer_start": 203, "text": "1901"}], "question": "When was Marconi's radio demonstration?", "id": "56e0fc3f7aa994140058e879"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 476, "text": "1943"}, {"answer_start": 476, "text": "1943"}, {"answer_start": 476, "text": "1943"}], "question": "When were Tesla's patents restored?", "id": "56e0fc3f7aa994140058e87a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 484, "text": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, {"answer_start": 484, "text": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, {"answer_start": 484, "text": "Supreme Court of the United States"}], "question": "A decision made by what entity restored Tesla's patents?", "id": "56e0fc3f7aa994140058e87b"}]}, {"context": "On 17 May 1899, Tesla moved to Colorado Springs, where he would have room for his high-voltage, high-frequency experiments; his lab was located near Foote Ave. and Kiowa St. He chose this location because the polyphase alternating current power distribution system had been introduced there and he had associates who were willing to give him all the power he needed without charging for it.

The park has a multi-use amphitheatre that seats up to 2,500 people, authentic Japanese Garden, fenced dog park, two-mile (3 km) equestrian trail, exercise par course, three children's playgrounds, a lake, 3 small ponds, 7 picnic areas and five miles (8 km) of multipurpose trails that are part of the San Joaquin River Parkway's Lewis S. Eaton Trail. When complete, the Lewis S. Eaton trail system will cover 22 miles (35 km) between Highway 99 and Friant Dam. The park's numerous picnic tables make for a great picnic destination and a convenient escape from city life.

Against the teaching of his day that the righteous acts of believers are performed in cooperation with God, Luther wrote that Christians receive such righteousness entirely from outside themselves; that righteousness not only comes from Christ but actually is the righteousness of Christ, imputed to Christians (rather than infused into them) through faith. \"That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law,\" he wrote. \"Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ.\" Faith, for Luther, was a gift from God; the experience of being justified by faith was \"as though I had been born again.\" His entry into Paradise, no less, was a discovery about \"the righteousness of God\" \u2013 a discovery that \"the just person\" of whom the Bible speaks (as in Romans 1:17) lives by faith.

Contemporary Lutheran scholarship, however, has found a different reality in Luther. Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to. Bernhard Lohse, for example, has demonstrated in his classic work \"Fides und Ratio\" that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together. More recently, Hans-Peter Grosshans has demonstrated that Luther's work on Biblical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method. This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible makes sense to itself, that it has internal coherence. The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than reason, which for him is the field of science, philosophy, history and empirical observation.

The theologians were not prepared to make a general ruling, and they reluctantly advised the landgrave that if he was determined, he should marry secretly and keep quiet about the matter. As a result, on 4 March 1540, Philip married a second wife, Margarethe von der Saale, with Melanchthon and Bucer among the witnesses.

Some scholars see Luther's influence as limited, and the Nazis' use of his work as opportunistic. Biographer Martin Brecht points out that \"There is a world of difference between his belief in salvation and a racial ideology. Nevertheless, his misguided agitation had the evil result that Luther fatefully became one of the 'church fathers' of anti-Semitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the Jews, cloaking it with the authority of the Reformer.\" Johannes Wallmann argues that Luther's writings against the Jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries, and that there was no continuity between Luther's thought and Nazi ideology. Uwe Siemon-Netto agreed, arguing that it was because the Nazis were already anti-Semites that they revived Luther's work. Hans J. Hillerbrand agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in German history.

For small n, say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 1012 operations each second, the program would run for about 4 \u00d7 1010 years, which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe. Even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress.
